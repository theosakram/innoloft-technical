# Usage

First, clone the repo, then install the dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

Then run it

```bash
yarn dev
```

## NOTES

There are prevalent server error, from what I've read on multiple github ticket this issue is with next13. I only use it because I'm curious on how it changes from the previous version. For now, just close the port and redo the yarn dev.
