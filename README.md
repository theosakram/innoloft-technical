# Usage

1. Clone the repo
2. Rename .env.local.example -> .env.local
3. Install dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

4. Run it

```bash
yarn dev
```

## NOTES

There are prevalent server error, from what I've read on multiple github ticket this issue is with next13. I only use it because I'm curious on how it changes from the previous version. For now, just close the port and redo the yarn dev.
